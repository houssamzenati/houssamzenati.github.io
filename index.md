I am a final year PhD student at [INRIA Thoth](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/) under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) as well as [Pierre Gaillard](http://pierre.gaillard.me/) and belong to the causal inference research group in the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/research-team/). My research interests lie in the interface of counterfactual reasoning and online learning algorithms. 

Prior to that, I received a M.Eng. degree in applied mathematics and computer science from [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) as well as the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) M.Sc. degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

Previously, I worked at the [Institute for Infocomm Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) under the supervision of [Chuan-Sheng Foo](http://ai.stanford.edu/~csfoo/) and [Vijay Chandrasekhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KUt4JCAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I also like learning Japanese and discovering its heritage, [as you may see here](./another-page.html).
