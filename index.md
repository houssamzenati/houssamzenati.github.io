I am a final year PhD student at [INRIA Thoth](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/) under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) as well as [Pierre Gaillard](http://pierre.gaillard.me/) and belong to the causal inference research group in the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/research-team/). My research interests lie in the interface of counterfactual reasoning and online learning algorithms. 

Prior to that, I received a M.Eng. degree in applied mathematics and computer science from [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) as well as the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) M.Sc. degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

Previously, I worked at the [Institute for Infocomm Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) under the supervision of [Chuan-Sheng Foo](http://ai.stanford.edu/~csfoo/) and [Vijay Chandrasekhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KUt4JCAAAAAJ&hl=en).

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
